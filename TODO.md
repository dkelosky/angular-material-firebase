How it works page:

- Check notifies on behalf of organizations.
  - Organizations can't access personal information, they can trigger notifications, but they shouldn't be able to send advertisements unsolicited.

Server field validation, unique name or url mapping in organization

- service to deal with Org names, uniqueness, and URI
